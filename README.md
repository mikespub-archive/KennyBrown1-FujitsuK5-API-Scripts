Fujitsu K5 API script repository

This repository contains the API script that I have put
together when building an environment within the Fujitsu K5 IaaS cloud.

Any use of the scripts within this repository is at your own
risk. Testing is advised prior to running in a live environment.

# Instructions

These scripts were run from a Centos 7 VM outside the
Fujitsu K5 platform, but they should run ok from any internet connected
machine.

1 - Populate the k5Default.rc file with your K5 Account
details (All the scripts rely on this file so make sure the path is correct
within the script.

2 - Generate authentication token using token.sh

3 - Populate the variables within the script you want to run

4 - Run the script
